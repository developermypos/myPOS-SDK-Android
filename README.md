# myPOS SDK Android

This repository provides a native Android SDK, which enables to integrate your Mobile App with myPOS Card terminals, processed by its platform, to accept card payments (including but not limited to VISA, Mastercard, UnionPay International, JCB, Bancontact). myPOS SDK Android communicates transparently to the card terminal(s) via Bluetooth. To process checkout SDK provides management of the terminal to complete all the steps for transaction processing, return or refund, card storage for recurring transactions, and communicates to the application transaction status, card token, card masked PAN.

No sensitive card data is ever passed through to or stored on the merchant&#39;s phone. All data is encrypted by the card terminal, which has been fully certified to the highest industry standards (PCI, EMV I &amp; II, Visa, MasterCard &amp; Amex).

# Integration

## Installation
Add the repository to your gradle dependencies:

```java
allprojects {
   repositories {
   	mavenCentral()
   }
}
```

Add the dependency to a module:

```java
implementation 'com.mypos:slavesdk:2.1.7'
```


## Initialization

Initialize the MyPos components in your app:

```Java
public class SampleApplication extends Application {
	
private POSHandler  mPOSHandler;

@Override
public void onCreate() {
	super.onCreate();
	POSHandler.setCurrency(Currency.EUR);
        POSHandler.setApplicationContext(this);
 	mPOSHandler = POSHandler.getInstance();
}
```

Optional settting for default receipt configuration is avaibale:

```Java
POSHandler.setDefaultReceiptConfig(POSHandler.RECEIPT_PRINT_ONLY_MERCHANT_COPY);
```

If set the default receipt configuration can be removed:

```Java
POSHandler.clearDefaultReceiptConfig();
```

Optional setting for the language of the receipts is avaibale(default is Language.ENGLISH):

```Java
POSHandler.setLanguage(Language.GERMAN);
```

isTerminalBusy() returns boolean to check if an operation is being performed at the moment:
```Java
POSHandler.getInstance().isTerminalBusy();
```

## Connect to terminal

Choose connection type:

```Java
POSHandler.setConnectionType(ConnectionType.BLUETOOTH); // Use ConnectionType.USB for usb connection type
```

```Java
POSHandler.getInstance().connectDevice(context);
```

If connection type is set to BLUETOOTH, make sure needed permissions are given in order to discover available bluetooth devices.

```Java
if (POSHandler.getInstance().checkPermissions(context)) {
    // continue...
} else {
    // permissions request is sent...
}
 ```
 
 Handle permissions result.
 
 ```Java
@Override
public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, @NonNull String[] permissions, @NonNull int[] grantResults) {
    if (requestCode == POSHandler.PERMISSIONS_REQUEST_CODE) {
        // check permissions result...
    }
}
```

## Attach connection listener

```Java
mPOSHandler.setConnectionListener(new ConnectionListener() {
    @Override
    public void onConnected(final BluetoothDevice device) {
        // handle connected event here
    }
});
```


## Attach pos ready listener

```Java
mPOSHandler.setPOSReadyListener(new POSReadyListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPOSReady() {
        // now you can start a transaction
    }
});
```

## Send E-Receipt

In case you want to use email/phone receipt you have to choose POSHandler.RECEIPT_E_RECEIPT receipt configuration.

Following listener will be fired immediately after transaction is approved:

```Java
POSHandler.getInstance().setPOSCredentialsListener(new POSCredentialsListener() {
    @Override
    public void askForCredentials(final CredentialsListener listener) {
	listener.onCredentialsSet("email@example.com"); // instead of email you can pass a phone number
    }
});
```

## Make payment

Once initialization is completed, you can start using the myPOS SDK Android to accept card payments.

Variant 1. 
Payment via internal SDK activity:
Amount and transaction reference are optional parameters and can be set as null.

```Java
 mPOSHandler.openPaymentActivity(
        MainActivity.this /*activity*/,
        REQUEST_CODE_MAKE_PAYMENT /*requestCode*/,
        "10.50" /*amount*/,
        UUID.randomUUID().toString()/*transaction reference*/
);
```

Variant 2. 
Payment via direct SDK method:
Transaction reference is optional parameter and can be set as null.

```Java
mPOSHandler.purchase(
	"10.50" /*amount*/, 
	UUID.randomUUID().toString() /*transaction reference*/, 
	POSHandler.RECEIPT_PRINT_AUTOMATICALLY /*receipt configuration*/ );
	);
```

## Handle payment result

Variant 1. 
Payment via internal SDK activity:

```Java
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data){
    	if( requestCode == REQUEST_CODE_MAKE_PAYMENT && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
        		TransactionData transactionData = data.getParcelableExtra(POSHandler.INTENT_EXTRA_TRANSACTION_DATA);
        		// Handle the response here
    	}
}
```

Variant 2. 
Payment via direct SDK method:

```Java
mPOSHandler.setPOSInfoListener(new POSInfoListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPOSInfoReceived(final int command, final int status, final String description) {
        // Handle the response here
    }

    @Override
    public void onTransactionComplete(final TransactionData transactionData) {
        // Handle the response here
    }
});

POSHandler.getInstance().setTransactionClearedListener(new PosTransactionClearedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onComplete(int phStatus) {
	// transaction is cleared and fully completed, terminal is ready for new operations
    }
});
```
See [POS Info statuses](#pos-info-statuses) for more information

## Refund

With refund host application could initiate refund transaction to the customersâ€™ card account with the specified amount.

Variant 1. 
Refund via internal SDK activity:
Amount and transaction reference are optional parameters and can be set as null.

```Java
 mPOSHandler.openPaymentActivity(
        MainActivity.this /*activity*/,
        REQUEST_CODE_MAKE_REFUND /*requestCode*/,
        "10.50" /*amount*/,
        UUID.randomUUID().toString()/*transaction reference*/
);
```

Variant 2. 
Refund via direct SDK method:
Transaction reference is optional parameter and can be set as null.

```Java
mPOSHandler.refund(
	"10.50" /*amount*/, 
	UUID.randomUUID().toString() /*transaction reference*/, 
	POSHandler.RECEIPT_PRINT_AUTOMATICALLY /*receipt configuration*/ );
	);
```

## Handle refund result

Variant 1. 
Refund via internal SDK activity:

```Java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data){
    	if( requestCode == REQUEST_CODE_MAKE_REFUND && resultCode == RESULT_OK) {
        		TransactionData transactionData = data.getParcelableExtra(POSHandler.INTENT_EXTRA_TRANSACTION_DATA);
        		// Handle the response here
    	}
}
```

Variant 2. 
Refund via direct SDK method:

```Java
mPOSHandler.setPOSInfoListener(new POSInfoListener() {
    @Override
    public void onPOSInfoReceived(final int command, final int status, final String description) {
        // Handle the response here
    }

    @Override
    public void onTransactionComplete(final TransactionData transactionData) {
        // Handle the response here
    }
});

POSHandler.getInstance().setTransactionClearedListener(new PosTransactionClearedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onComplete(int phStatus) {
	// transaction is cleared and fully completed, terminal is ready for new operations
    }
});
```
See [POS Info statuses](#pos-info-statuses) for more information

## Reprint last receipt

With this method host application could request reprint of last transaction slip.

```Java
mPOSHandler.reprintReceipt();
```

## Print random receipt

Check if the connected myPOS device has a printer hardware:

```Java
mPOSHandler.hasPrinter()
```

Printing an external receipt is performed by passing a ReceiptData object to the printReceipt() method

```Java
ReceiptData receiptData = new ReceiptData();
receiptData.addLogo(1 /*Logo index*/);
receiptData.addEmptyRow();
receiptData.addRow(
	"HEAD" /*text*/, 
	ReceiptData.Align.CENTER, /* Enum align setting (LEFT, CENTER, RIGHT) */
	ReceiptData.FontSize.DOUBLE /* Enum font size setting (SINGLE, DOUBLE) */
	);
mPOSHandler.printReceipt(receiptData);
```

# Terminal management

## Activate terminal

Before using terminal for a first time the SDK has to initiate Terminal activation, which will setup terminal for processing transaction, setting up Terminal ID, Merchant ID etc.

```Java
mPOSHandler.activate();
```

## Update terminal software

Each time terminal processing transaction, processor host checks for existing pending updates, and inform terminal if any. In that case by this method software update is activated, and terminal is going in the update mode.

```Java
mPOSHandler.update();
```

## Deactivate terminal

```Java
mPOSHandler.deactivate();
```
